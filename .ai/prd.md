# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - JulklApp
## 1. Product Overview
JulklApp is a web application that automates the creation and management of Secret Santa events (draws) for small groups (3–32 participants). Draw authors can register, create events, and input participant details. After conducting the draw, participants are auto-provisioned accounts and can log in to view their assigned recipient along with AI-generated gift suggestions based on free-text preference letters. The application emphasizes simplicity, security, and future localization support.

## 2. User Problem
Friends and families organizing Secret Santa lack a simple, secure tool to:
- Collect participant information (name, surname, email, gift preferences).
- Ensure fair, one-to-one matching without self-matches.
- Share match results privately with each participant.
- Generate and display personalized gift suggestions without manual effort.
- Manage events without complex manual coordination or email confirmations.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- FR-001: User authentication and registration for draw authors via email/password.
- FR-002: Secure login for participants with first-time password setup.
- FR-003: Create Secret Santa draw with 3–32 participants.
- FR-004: Input and store participant details: name, surname, email (required), gift-preferences letter (plain text, max 10 000 chars).
- FR-005: Enforce participant count (min 3, max 32) and gift-preferences length limit at input.
- FR-006: Execute draw algorithm producing one distinct match per participant; prohibit self-matching.
- FR-007: Auto-provision participant accounts immediately after draw; require password set on first login.
- FR-008: Implement row-level security: authors see only their draws; participants see only their own match.
- FR-009: Display match results on a dedicated page for each participant.
- FR-010: Integrate AI gift suggestion via XHR to OpenRouter (configured in .env) with retry logic (up to 3 retries, 30 s timeout).
- FR-011: Cache AI suggestions indefinitely; provide manual refresh button without rate limiting.
- FR-012: Prevent authors from modifying or deleting draws after creation.
- FR-013: Wrap all UI strings in an i18n abstraction for future localization.
