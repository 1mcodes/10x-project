## Project Description

JulklApp solves the hassle of organizing Secret Santa by providing:

- Secure email/password authentication for event authors and participants  
- Participant management with validation (3–32 participants, letter length ≤10 000 chars)  
- Fair, one-to-one matching algorithm with no self-matches  
- Auto-provisioned participant accounts and first-time password setup  
- Row-level security: authors see only their draws; participants see only their match  
- Dedicated match page showing recipient details and gift preferences  
- AI-powered gift suggestions via OpenRouter.ai (3 retry attempts, 30 s timeout)  
- Indefinite caching of AI suggestions with manual refresh  
- All UI strings wrapped in i18n abstraction (English UI, ready for localization)  

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**  
- Astro 5 – static-first pages with minimal JavaScript  
- React 19 – interactive components  
- TypeScript 5 – static typing and IDE support  
- Tailwind CSS 4 – utility-first styling  
- Shadcn/ui – accessible React component library  

**Backend**  
- Supabase – PostgreSQL database, SDK, and built-in authentication  

**AI Integration**  
- OpenRouter.ai – unified access to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models; API key cost limits  

**CI/CD & Hosting**  
- GitHub Actions – build, lint, test pipelines  
- DigitalOcean (Docker) – containerized deployment  

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.14.0 (see `.nvmrc`)

# SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
# SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
